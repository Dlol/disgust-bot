# disgust-bot
## What is it?
Disgust-bot is the bot (and original!) version of disgust, an anonymous chatting app!

## How do I set it up?
1. Go into index.js and change the two variables at the top to your bot's client id and the message id of the channel you want disgust to send it to.
2. run `node .` or `pm2 start index.js` to start!

(Tell me if it doesn't work!)

## How do I use it?
You can either DM the bot with the prefix `>` or in any channel in the server using the prefix `>`
The bot will then send the message to the channel that you specify.
